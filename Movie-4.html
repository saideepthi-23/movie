<h2>CRASH LANDING ON YOU</h2>
 
<p>One day, while Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) is paragliding in Seoul, a sudden tornado blows her off course and knocks her out. She awakens to find her paraglide hanging in a tree in a forest in the North Korean portion of the DMZ. There she meets Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin), who eventually gives her shelter and develops plans to help her return to South Korea secretly. Over time, they fall in love, despite the divide between their respective countries.Back in South Korea, Yoon Se-ri's family suppresses the news of her disappearance, fearing it will depress the stock price of Queens Group. Just before Se-ri went missing, her retiring father had told his family that he intended to make her his successor, based on her ability as a businesswoman, which she proved by building her own company, Seri's Choice. Her half-brothers, Yoon Se-jun (Choi Dae-hoon) and Yoon Se-hyung (Park Hyung-soo), each hoped to be their father's replacement but they have struggled to manage the subsidiaries under their control. The brothers are supported by equally-ambitious wives, Do Hye-ji (Hwang Woo-seul-hye) and Go Sang-ah (Yoon Ji-min), respectively. In Se-ri's absence, Se-hyung uses unscrupulous means to win the succession battle, while his wife Sang-ah attempts to take over Se-ri's Choice.</p>
